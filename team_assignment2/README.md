# Team project (mentor-mentee matching web system)
# The Project objective
The project objective was to implement a mentor-mentee matching web system for the University of Sheffield	. This application will allow mentors and mentees to set up profiles, and will match them based on their industry. Mentees will be able to send requests to mentors, who can then choose to accept or reject them. This system will be developed solely for use by The University of Sheffield. 		
# The development process
The process was done in an agile development environment (read more in the assignment2 and assignment1 brief).
# The final result
According to the client feedback, 98% of the desired functionalities were implemented. Specifically, I was assigned to work on the views (front-end) mainly as well as creating the mock-ups designs for the website. The resulting implementation of the design was professional and easy to navigate and the layout with the university logo looked very good according to the client. 
# What I have learned
I believe that the success of this team project was mainly due to the good communication skills everyone demonstrated for the whole duration of the project. There were consistent meetings and sharing of thoughts which led us to work in sync even though we never met in person and all of the work was done remotely. By the end of the project, I knew that I liked front-end development, design and aesthetics parts of it and as a result I plan to learn more HTML and CSS in the future.
